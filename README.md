# Exploratory Data Analysis of Data Analyst Jobs

## Background
In an age where data is often hailed as the "new oil," the role of a Data Analyst stands as a crucial bridge between raw information and informed decision-making. With the ever-growing demand for data-driven insights, the landscape of data analysis jobs is continually evolving. The question that often arises is, "What skills and qualifications are in demand in this dynamic field?"
This exploratory data analysis project was born out my interest in data science, and as I was learning and searching for the skills that are required in data analyst jobs. This exploration takes us into the heart of the data industry, where we delve into the job listings on some of the most prominent platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn. 
The goal? To unravel the secrets hidden within the job descriptions and discover the skills and qualifications that can open the doors to a thriving career in data analysis.

## General Information About The Project:
It involves not only data collection but also data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization. We'll uncover the frequency of keywords, examine the distribution of job locations, and dissect the seniority levels that employers seek. Our toolkit includes Python, Pandas, and Plotly, allowing us to transform raw job listings into valuable insights.

## EDA Conclusions:

The distributions of both minimum and maximum salary ranges. The range of minimum salaries is wider, indicating there is a larger variety of starting salary estimates. On the other hand, the range of maximum salaries is narrower, suggesting a more constrained upper limit. The most common salary ranges are shown by two peaks around $60,000 and $90,000. Job seekers can use this information to negotiate their salary. For example, if the minimum salary range is acceptable but the maximum range is low, there might be room for negotiation.

This horizontal bar graph compares the demand for data analysts across different sectors. This helps in identifying which industries are more actively seeking data analysts. From this data, we can see that sectors like finance, business services (like legal, consulting, accounting, human resources) and healthcare are loking for more data analysts to hire.

To narrow it down, these are the top five sectors with the most number of DA job listings. These industries might have a high need for data analysis and insights, potentially indicating growth or data-driven decision-making.

Private v/s Public Ownership, private companies, including those owned by individuals, families, or private equity firms, have a higher count of job postings. This suggests that a significant number of data analyst positions are within privately-owned organizations. Publicly-traded companies have a relatively lower count of job postings. There are fewer job postings from government-owned entities. This implies that data analyst positions in government or public sector organizations are relatively less common.

That's insightful! SQL is indeed a fundamental skill for data analysts, as it allows them to query and manipulate databases effectively. Python's popularity in data analysis is also well-known due to its easy to understand coding language and powerful libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Additionally, Tableau and PowerBI are widely used for data visualization, which is a crucial aspect of data analysis.

Across the two locations, it's evident that job distributions for on-site, remote, and hybrid positions appear well-balanced. This presents favorable choices for data analysts, allowing them to align with companies that offer their preferred work mode.

This plot provides a quick, visual summary of how job postings are distributed across different work types in Canada and the United States.
The bars indicate the count of jobs posted, categorized by work type. The 'onsite' category refers to positions that require physical presence at a specific location, while 'remote' implies that the work can be done from a different location.
