# Exploratory Data Analysis of Data Analyst Jobs

## Background
In an age where data is often hailed as the "new oil," the role of a Data Analyst stands as a crucial bridge between raw information and informed decision-making. With the ever-growing demand for data-driven insights, the landscape of data analysis jobs is continually evolving. The question that often arises is, "What skills and qualifications are in demand in this dynamic field?"
This exploratory data analysis project was born out my interest in data science, and as I was learning and searching for the skills that are required in data analyst jobs. This exploration takes us into the heart of the data industry, where we delve into the job listings on some of the most prominent platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn. 
The goal? To unravel the secrets hidden within the job descriptions and discover the skills and qualifications that can open the doors to a thriving career in data analysis.

## General Information About The Project:
It involves not only data collection but also data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization. We'll uncover the frequency of keywords, examine the distribution of job locations, and dissect the seniority levels that employers seek. Our toolkit includes Python, Pandas, and Plotly, allowing us to transform raw job listings into valuable insights.
